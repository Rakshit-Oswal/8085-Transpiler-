THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETE. 

This project is made to visualize 8085 code's end result in some sort of GUI. At the moment, it only contains the lexer for the 8085 asm code.
A complete "transpiler" is in the works to convert 8085 asm code to C/CPP code (yet undecided between the two) and then use that higher level code to communicate with some graphics API and represent the execution as it'd appear in a typical kit. Users will be able to cycle through the various registers, see the flag state among other things.
